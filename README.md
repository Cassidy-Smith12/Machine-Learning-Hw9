 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: balloons_extended.csv, use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict
 whether a balloon is inflated or not. Compute the accuracy score of the model and print the
 classification report as well as the Confusion Matrix both in text and as a visualization (use:
 test_size=0.20, random_state=0). In addition, print the most important features. Finally, create a
 visualization of the decision tree.

 Exercise 2:
 Similarly to Ex. 1, use a Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=100.

 Exercise 3:
 Given the following dataset: lenses.csv, use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a
 patient should be prescribed hard contact lenses, soft contact lenses, no contact lenses. Compute the
 accuracy score of the model and print the classification report as well as the Confusion Matrix
 both in text and as a visualization (use: test_size=0.30, random_state=0). In addition, print the
 most important features. Finally, create a visualization of the decision tree.

 Exercise 4:
 Similarly to Ex. 3, use a Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=500.
